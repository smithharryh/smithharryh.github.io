<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>Data Scientist/software engineer with MSc from St Andrews. Co-founded a data business in the retrofit space and found a passion for energy.</p>
<h2>The long version... </h2>
<p>I graduated from the University of St Andrews with an MSc in Digital Health (Computer science applied to healthcare) in December 2022. Before that I got a 1st in my Computer Science BSc. I've worked in the cyber security sector, the data science arena and the coding dojo. I combined these with an interest in the future of energy to co-found my first business <a href="www.ecofithomes.com">Ecofit Homes</a>. I built a ton of products from a REST API, to a web platform to an extensive data pipeline, some of which worked and made us money (üéâ), some of which didn't (‚õîÔ∏è) but were fun to try. I try and read broadly and keep a list of what I've read <a href="/books">here</a>, but mainly focus on classic fiction, AI, energy and history.</p>

<p>Now I am doing a deep dive into energy to understand what the future looks like and how to get there. I'm writing a blog to answer some of my own questions <a href="/blog/">here</a>. I would love feedback or suggestions but mainly write this just to organise thoughts/record what I've discovered, not for a wide audience!</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> I have done in the past (desperately needs updating) or my experience below.</p>

<h3>üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Experience</h3>

<strong> Ecofit Homes, Co-founder and CTO, UK - 2022 - </strong>

I cofounded Ecofit Homes and ran all technical development. We started as a one stop retrofit solution with a web platform for home improvement information and custom recommendations. We then pivoted into the data game and had some real successes, including selling our data to one of the biggest utility companies in the UK. Technical work included: Web Development (Django, Python, React, PostgreSQL), building a REST API (FastAPI, MongoDB, AWS) and crafting an extensive data pipeline (AWS, PySpark).

<strong> Cyber Threat Innovations Analyst, UK - 2022 - 2023</strong>

I returned to the company I worked with on my internship after my masters in a more senior role looking at both innovations and development, and cyber threat intelligence. I particularly looked at web application development in Python/Django/Flask, and data analysis.


<strong>Intelligence Analyst & Developer, Internship, UK ‚Äî 2019 - 2020 </strong>

Due do a non disclosure agreement, I am limited in what I can disclose about the tasks I undertook. However references and
further information are available.I worked as a developer and analyst at a not for profit company in the financial sector. I led the
development of a major company initiative, developing a web application using the Django framework. This involved writing and
managing the codebase, as well as presenting the application to senior executives at well known financial institutions. Other roles I
performed during my placement include writing Python and Bash scripts for intelligence gathering, open source research and
generating intelligence reports to be distributed widely within the industry. I was fortunate to be given a number of responsibilities
including running the daily update call with over 15 other corporations, and being added to the on-call out of hours employee rota.

<strong>Technical Specialist, Apple, UK ‚Äî 2018 </strong>

I provided technical support for customers at the largest corporation in the world. I was able to extensively improve my written and
oral communication and ability to deal with a variety of customers.

<strong>Business Intern, Network Rail, UK ‚Äî 2016-2017</strong>

I played a lead role in an ¬£8 million project, reporting to senior managers within the company nationwide. The systems and
organisational structure I created were continually used after I left.
