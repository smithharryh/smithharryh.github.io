<p>After graduating with a 1st class degree in Computer Science BSc, I am continuing my studies at the University of St Andrews where I am studying for an MSc in Digital Health. My main areas of interest (outside of Scotland Rugby and Arsenal), are Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and the implementations of technology for health. I <a href="/books">read a lot</a> and sometimes <a href="/blog/blog">write about what I've read or other things</a>. (or I will do this eventually...)

I am always happy to talk about anything mentioned on the site. Get in touch with the links at the bottom of the page.
