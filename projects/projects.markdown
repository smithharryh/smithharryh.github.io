I have added some projects I have worked/am currently working on below. Take a look and get in touch with any questions.


<h3> Audio Event Detection for Emergency Service Vehicles (2020 - 2021) </h3>

<i> Deep Learning, Tensorflow, Jupyter, Python </i>

This was my final year dissertation project of my undergraduate computer science degree. I build 4 deep learning (DL) models and  a web app to look at using audio for siren detection. The aim was to train models to deploy for a) accessibility and b) driverless cars, but was mainly tailored at educating me on DL. It was very fun getting a DL model actually working and classifying results and I learnt a lot on model types and DL development. I have included a link to my final report below.

<h3> Web Application Development (2019 - 2020) </h3>

<i>Django, Git, D3.js, Bootstrap  </i>

During my placement year on my undergrad degree I worked as a developer and analyst at a cyber security company in the financial sector. I learnt a ton and undertook my first major project: a web application to manage user data and output generated insights. I am limited in what I can say due to an NDA, but the project was a year long and the biggest project I have undertaken thus far.
