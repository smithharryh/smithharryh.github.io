I have added some projects I have worked/am currently working on below. Take a look and get in touch with any questions.

<h3> HarryCoin - Making my own Cryptocurrency </h3>

<i> Python, Flask, Postman </i>

I've been intrigued by crypto for a wee while, but have never explored it particularly deeply. I own a tiny amount of bitcoin and have done for a couple of years which is cool but my understanding of how it works have been surface level. I haven't writtne much Python in the last few months so I thought the best way to learn would be to build my own cryptocurrency from scratch in Python. My main guide is <a href="https://medium.com/@nathan_149/making-my-own-cryptocurrency-from-scratch-42e05d4460c2"> here</a>, but I'll be taking inspiration from other places I'll reference on my github <a href= "https://github.com/smithharryh/HarryCoin">here</a>. My stretch goal would be to host it on my Raspberry Pi but for now I'll focus on writing the code.


<h3> Audio Event Detection for Emergency Service Vehicles (2020 - 2021) </h3>

<i> Deep Learning, Tensorflow, Jupyter, Python </i>

This was my final year dissertation project of my undergraduate computer science degree. I build 4 deep learning (DL) models and  a web app to look at using audio for siren detection. The aim was to train models to deploy for a) accessibility and b) driverless cars, but was mainly tailored at educating me on DL. It was very fun getting a DL model actually working and classifying results and I learnt a lot on model types and DL development. I have included a link to my final report below.

<h3> Web Application Development (2019 - 2020) </h3>

<i>Django, Git, D3.js, Bootstrap  </i>

During my placement year on my undergrad degree I worked as a developer and analyst at a cyber security company in the financial sector. I learnt a ton and undertook my first major project: a web application to manage user data and output generated insights. I am limited in what I can say due to an NDA, but the project was a year long and the biggest project I have undertaken thus far.
